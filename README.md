### 🛠️How to set up the project

After cloning the project, do `npm install` and `npm run start`, you will see the project in your local at `localhost:3000`

### 🤖Tech stack

I use React and emotion mainly for the application.
Due to the simple logic and the components structure at this stage, I use component composition approach for sharing the state around so component such as `CustomCheckBox` doesn't have to pass data to other components to know whether it is checked or not.
